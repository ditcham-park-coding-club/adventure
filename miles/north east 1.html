after travling a long way the wait of your rucksac seems to be hevyer then ever
the snow blinds you but in the distence you see a settelment you you quicly rush
over to the settelment. you run into the streets to find an inn you head inside
and soon find your self faling asleep in an rented room

<p>
you awake to the smell of smoke you run to the window to see nothing but fire you run down the stairs to find more fire you grab your trusty sword and sheild
