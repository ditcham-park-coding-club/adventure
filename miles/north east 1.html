after traveling a long way the weight of your rucksak seems to be heavier then
ever,the snow blinds you but in the distance you see a settlement, you quickly
rushover to the settlement. You run into the streets to find an inn, you head
insideand soon find your self falling asleep in an rented room.
</p>
<p>
you awake to the smell of smoke, you run to the window to see nothing but fire
you run down the stairs to find more fire you grab your trusty sword and shield
 you rush out to see the culprits of the fire <b> do you stay and fight or do
    you run</b>
