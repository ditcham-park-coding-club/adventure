  Ooh, well done, you just got eight ukulele strings!!! Way to go man!!
  <p> </p>
In front of you is a penguin telling you that he needs money.

But you can only give him anchovies.
<p> </p>
NB: Penguins <i>hate</i> anchovies!
<p> </p>
SO DON'T GIVE HIM ANY!

COS HE MIGHT STRANGLE YOU IN YOUR SLEEP!
<p> </p>
<i>However, he does like cod, so if you happen to grab any on your way back he would be much delighted.</i>
